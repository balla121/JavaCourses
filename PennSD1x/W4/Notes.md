- Overloading: 
    - methods with the same name, but different argument lists
        - Signature of the method â€“ the name of the method, the datatypes of the arguments (includes the number of arguments, the order in which they occur)
    - constructors in a class with different argument lists
        - *first* call the other constructor with the keyword **this**
